# Basic

Basic is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that provides a carefully selected subset of essential commands, inspired by Essentials but without the unnecessary bloat. It is designed for simplicity, and ease of use.
Why Basic?

Many general-purpose plugins like Essentials come packed with a wide range of features—some useful, others rarely needed. Basic strips away everything unnecessary, focusing only on core commands that players and server administrators frequently use.

For example, many servers already use dedicated plugins for handling nicknames, chat formatting, economy, permissions, and teleportation systems, so there’s no need for Basic to duplicate those features. Instead, it focuses on core "basic" and administration tools without interfering with existing plugins.

## Features

- A selection of useful administrative and player commands.
